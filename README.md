[00:00.02] It's not what Heaven is, it's what it could be
[00:04.84] With new management in charge, like you, and you, and me
[00:32.84] 
[00:12.84] Once we get up there and snag that angelic throne
[00:20.04] Our unholy trinity could make their realm our own
[00:25.11] We'll pack up all their piety and redecorate
[00:30.16] Bet our tower would look powerful with pearlier gates
[00:56.66] 
[00:35.08] Once we get up there, up to the promised land
[00:39.56] A hundred billion souls await our every command
[00:43.19] We're the biggest fish in hell, how 'bout we upgrade the bowl?
[00:47.07] It's time for growth, let's rule 'em both, take total control!
[01:18.07] 
[00:50.95] Think of all your dreams that could come true
[00:53.18] (Even the wet ones?)
[00:54.14] Yeah, those too, imagine what it could enable (for my label)
[00:57.92] Yes, a heavenly host that bows to none but us
[01:00.42] (I can have hot new angel sluts?)
[01:02.38] (Tear off their wings and make them dresses!)
[01:04.57] And what's best is
[01:13.57] 
[01:05.44] That dumb princess showed us the way
[01:09.06] To make those haloed cabronas pay
[01:12.86] And once we're gods, I can't wait to say
[01:16.54] To everyone who doubted me, your doubting days are done!
[01:19.80] You'll be cornered, trapped, and tortured
[01:21.57] Then I'll end you, just for fun
[01:37.07] 
[01:24.61] Once we get up there, the shining kingdom of God
[01:30.97] No more petty squabbles with the dead
[01:33.63] As we stroll the Golden Promenade
[01:36.18] What's an overlord to a deity? They ain't got a prayer
[01:39.71] (It'll be so nice in Paradise)
[01:41.64] (With a splash of vice, they'll pay the price)
[01:43.62] (We'll rule the sky from up on high)
[01:45.51] Once I (and I, and I) get up there
[02:02.51] 
[01:54.86] They're fucked!
