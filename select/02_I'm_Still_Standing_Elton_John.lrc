[00:11.97] You could never know what it's like
[00:14.12] Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
[00:16.64] And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
[00:19.33] You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
[00:50.83] 
[00:25.58] And did you think this fool could never win?
[00:27.75] Well, look at me, I'm coming back again
[00:30.19] I got a taste of love in a simple way
[00:32.94] And if you need to know while I'm still standing, you just fade away
[01:06.94] 
[00:38.09] Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
[00:43.37] Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
[00:49.48] I'm still standing after all this time
[00:54.28] Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
[01:21.78] 
[00:59.60] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:05.03] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:23.53] 
[01:11.37] Once I never could have hoped to win
[01:13.76] You're starting down the road leaving me again
[01:16.46] The threats you made were meant to cut me down
[01:19.01] And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now
[01:48.01] 
[01:24.64] You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
[01:29.42] Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
[01:35.37] I'm still standing after all this time
[01:40.31] Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
[02:07.81] 
[01:45.55] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:50.88] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:09.38] 
[02:10.23] Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
[02:15.39] Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
[02:21.35] I'm still standing after all this time
[02:26.17] Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
[02:53.67] 
[02:31.42] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:36.89] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:42.27] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:47.69] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:52.91] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:58.00] I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
